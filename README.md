# FirstSpringBootProject

[![current version](https://img.shields.io/badge/current_version-1.0-green)](#FirstSpringBootProject)

This web application was created as part of the [Java Spring Boot lessons](https://itproger.com/course/java-spring) and is a simple web blog.

Here the functionality is implemented for displaying static web pages, dynamic web pages (using the Thymeleaf) and for working with the MySQL database (creating, editing and deleting blog articles).

This is my first Java Spring Boot application :)
